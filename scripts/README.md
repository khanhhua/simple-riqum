README
======

This directory should store
- app.yaml
- gcloud-app-deploy.sh
- README.md (this file)
- service-keyfile.json

As for the last on `service-keyfile.json`, for security reason I don't
store the Google Cloud API service account keyfile here.

Either you should have this file in your email as I have personally sent
you OR you should create a new Google Cloud project and obtain one your
self!

Happy Coding!
